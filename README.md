# Image-Classification
Course Introduction to AI Project
In this project, three classifiers are designed: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. 
You can test classifiers on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images in which edges have already been detected. 
Even with simple features, designed classifiers are able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.
