# Image-Classification
In this project, three classifiers are designed: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. 
You can test classifiers on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images in which edges have already been detected. </br>
Even with simple features, designed classifiers are able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.</br>
More descriptions are in the classification.html</br>
